# binarysearch_tree - CPP
Brent Voyles 

    Description:
    This program takes user input values and properly adds them to a binary search tree.
    The program then allows a user to search for a value in the binary search tree
    and if the number is found, it shows the traversal required to reach the value.
    If not the program informs the user that the value was not found and shows the
    attempted traversal to find the value.

    To compile this code:
    g++ SearchTree.cpp -o SearchTree.out
